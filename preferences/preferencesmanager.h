    * We implemented a powerful tool which helps contributors to make it easier.
    * We will see all required steps to load/save and update data.

    * <h3>First thing at all</h3> You need to get pointer to this class by including preferencesmanager.h. Don't forget to add pointer to PreferencesManager into your class.
    * Now, it's better if you get the address of the unique instance of the preferences manager, this can be done by calling the static function PreferencesManager::getInstance();
